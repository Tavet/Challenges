# Sliding Window
The **sliding window** pattern is used to process sequential data, arrays, and strings, for example, to efficiently solve subarray or substring problems. It involves maintaining a dynamic window that slides through the array or string, adjusting its boundaries as needed to track relevant elements or characters. The window is used to slide over the data in chunks corresponding to the window size, and this can be set according to the problemâ€™s requirements. It may be viewed as a variation of the two pointers pattern, with the pointers being used to set the window bounds.
