# Fast and Slow Pointers

Similar to the two pointers pattern, the fast and slow pointers pattern uses two pointers to traverse an iterable data structure, but at different speeds, often to identify patterns, detect cycles, or find specific elements.

The key idea is that the pointers start at the same location and then start moving at different speeds. Generally, the slow pointer moves forward by a factor of one, and the fast pointer moves by a factor of two.
